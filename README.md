# Shelter-Cats-Time-to-Adoption-Survival-Analysis

These are the final project files from my Survival Analysis class. In a previous project, I looked at factors influencing adoption for shelter cats using the
openly provided Austin Animal Outcomes Dataset. I used that same dataset for this project, but this time, I examined the relationship between various factors and
time to adoption for these cats. 

I cleaned the data in R but analyzed the data in SAS due to some class requirements. The final paper serves as a summary of the process and results as well as a
writing sample.
